Hi, I’m @Frexet! 👋

👨‍💻 Tech Explorer – I’ve been tinkering with computers since I could reach the keyboard. From hardware mods to software hacks – if it involves tech, I’ve probably tried it.

🎮 Gamer at Heart – When I’m not coding, you’ll find me deep in epic raids, LAN parties, or climbing the Hearthstone ladder with my guild Orka. Gaming is life.

🌍 Open Source Advocate – I believe in the power of collaboration and love contributing to projects that bring real value. GitHub is where passion meets purpose.

🚀 Always Learning – Whether it’s a new programming language, a cutting-edge tool, or an emerging trend, I’m always hungry to grow and improve.

🧙 WoW & Hearthstone Nerd – Big fan of fantasy strategy games. I live for lore, teamwork, and perfectly timed plays.

☕ Fueled by Coffee – Coding without caffeine? Unthinkable. Let’s talk brewing methods and bean origins anytime!

🎨 Creative Technologist – I love blending logic with creativity through digital art, animations, and pixel-perfect design. Creativity keeps the code flowing.

🎸 Guitarist & DJ – Former music professional turned hobbyist. Music still plays a huge part in my creative process.

🎉 Event Geek – I’ve proudly been part of both Birdie and DreamHack – helping organize, host, and breathe life into some of the most unforgettable gaming and tech events in Sweden. Community is everything.
